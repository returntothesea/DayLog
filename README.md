**Origin**


I originally made this application so that I could keep track of feedings and naps after my daughter was born. I knew I'd have trouble remembering when she ate / fell asleep, or when the dog had been out or eaten last since our schedules would be all messed up. (Newborns, am I right?)


All you need to do is make buttons for your common actions and then click the button to log it on the left panel with a time stamp.

I had it hooked up to a Raspberry Pi that was connected to my living room TV during the first few weeks after she was born.
